# athletic_sales_analysis
- "You'll analyze sales data to gain insights into which cities in the U.S. have sold the most athletic wear over two years. Next, you'll determine which retailers had the greatest total sales for athletic wear, and which retailers sold the most women's athletic footwear. Finally, you'll determine which day and week had the highest sales for women's athletic footwear."
## Code Considerations
- A tutor helped me to identify a more efficient function for determining if any values are null. 
- In part 2, he also showed me a way to rename the columns within a grouby function rather than breaking it up into two steps like I did.
- Throughout the assignment, the tutor helped me to update how I was displaying the groupbys and pivot tables. I was just displaying the first 5 rows in the dataframes, but he showed me how to sort those tables.
- A tutor also helped me to re-format my resampled tables. The instructions say to sort in ascending order, but if we want to determine who had the most, then we need to sort in descending order.
